<h1>About Me</h1>
My name is Victoria Cyrus, and I am an Igbo girl from Imo State, Nigeria. I hold a degree in Political Science from Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu-Alike, Ebonyi State. I am passionate about music and creativity, which I express through singing and songwriting. Recently, I expanded my skill set by acquiring expertise in web development, reflecting my dedication to continuous learning and growth.
I aim to become proficient in full-stack development, and to focus on web security.
I also aim to stay updated with new technologies like AI integration, blockchain, and Web3 development, and to lead a development team as a team lead or a project manager.
I have written a couple of songs that are available on all platforms.
I am very good with teamwork, and  I pride myself on being a problem solver. 
My hobbies are exploring tech development, singing, drawing, and visiting new places.
